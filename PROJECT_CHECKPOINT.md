## 📋 Email Template (Current Version)

```
Dear Trustees,

My name is [NAME], a [VOTER TYPE] residing at [ADDRESS].

I urge both Boards to approve the pending petition for detachment from Denton ISD and attachment to Prosper ISD under Texas Education Code §13.051.

To Prosper ISD: You should absolutely vote YES. These 274 students already attend your schools, yet you receive $0.00 in property taxes to educate them. This petition will:
• Generate $6.2 million annually for Prosper ISD operations
• Add $510M in taxable property for future bond capacity
• Give these families voting rights in PISD governance
• Align tax responsibility with educational responsibility

This is the only known case in Texas where students already attend the district they're petitioning to join. Approval is the fiscally responsible and morally correct decision.

To Denton ISD: The right decision is to vote YES and avoid costly litigation. Texas Supreme Court precedent and the Education Commissioner's authority strongly support this petition. With your recent November 2025 tax rate increase, spending taxpayer dollars fighting a likely losing battle is indefensible. These students don't attend your schools — do the right thing for them and your taxpayers.

This petition has majority voter support (52.63% of registered voters, 56.49% of addresses). It represents common-sense governance, fairness for students, and fiscal accountability.

I respectfully urge both Boards to approve this petition.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[NAME]
[ADDRESS]
[EMAIL]
