Hi,

I just took action on an important local issue and wanted 
to share it with you.

🚨 URGENT: The Prosper ISD and Denton ISD boards are voting 
on December 15 about a petition to permanently align 
Windsong Ranch students with Prosper ISD (where they 
already attend school).

This is about common-sense governance and ensuring tax 
dollars follow students to the district serving them.

Can you help? It takes just 2 minutes to send an email to 
both school boards:

Thanks for supporting good governance!

## 🚀 VIRAL GROWTH STRATEGY

### **Goal:** Get each user to share with 3+ people

### **Share Message Strategy:**
- ✅ Uses urgency: "🚨 URGENT"
- ✅ Mentions deadline: "Dec 15"
- ✅ Low friction: "takes 2 min"
- ✅ Social proof: "Every voice counts"
- ✅ Clear CTA: Link included

### **Viral Loop:**
1. User signs up → Gets success message
2. User clicks "Share" → Texts 3 friends
3. Friends click link → Land on page
4. Friends sign up → They share with 3 friends
5. **Exponential growth!**

---

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Viral Coefficient Calculation:**

**Current (before enhancement):**
- 100 people sign up
- 10% share (10 people)
- Each shares with 1 person
- = 10 new signups
- **Viral coefficient: 0.1** (not viral)

**After enhancement:**
- 100 people sign up
- 30% share (30 people) - easier to share
- Each shares with 3 people via text
- = 90 new signups
- **Viral coefficient: 0.9** (near viral!)

**If we hit 1.0+, growth becomes exponential!**

## 📈 TRACKING VIRAL GROWTH

### **In Google Sheets:**

Add a column to track referral source:
- Check if new signups come shortly after shares
- Look for clusters (multiple signups at same time)
- Track growth rate (signups per day)

### **Metrics to Monitor:**
1. **Signups per day** (should accelerate)
2. **Share button clicks** (console.log added)
3. **SMS link opens** (check analytics)
4. **Time between signups** (should decrease)

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Daily signups increasing exponentially
- ✅ Multiple signups within minutes
- ✅ Share rate >25%
- ✅ Average 2-3 shares per user
